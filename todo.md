# Priorities
- [ ] Integrate Spellcheck
- [ ] Fix eslint and get it to work with tslint.json files in contrail projects
- [ ] Set up tmux so I can bounce between various projects

## Update LSP
- [ ] Consider updating the lsp so that it updates it's warning during insert mode

```lua
vim.diagnostic.config({
  update_in_insert = true
})
```

### From a reddit post with a cool setup 
- [x] navic (with barbecue) or lsp saga

ESLINT
- [ ] Check out the instructions within the lazy wiki. There's a pattern that uses `lazyvim.plugins.extras...` to install eslint functionality


### Learn to navigate buffers
- Use `H` and `L` if the buffer you want to go to is visually close to where you are
- Otherwise, if the buffer is open, use `<leader>,`
- For other files, use `<leader><space>`
- Close buffers you no longer need with < leader>bd
- `<leader>ss` to quickly jump to a function in the buffer you're on
- `<c-o>`, `<c-i>` and gd to navigate the code
- You can pin buffers with `<leader>bp` and delete all non pinned buffers with `<leader>bP`
- Add `TODO`s in files you want to work on in future but don't need now and delete their buffers, git will track them


### Make nvim your default editor
- [ ] Create an "open in nvim" app that makes nvim in iterm the default editor for most files
- [ ] Update iterm app icon to be a terminal with a neovim logo (see reddit post from u/danbee "I made a neovim icon for macos". The high contrast icon looks best)

- [ ] leap.nvim (ggandor / leap.vim) - neovim's answer to the mouse
- [ ] flash.nvim (folke/flash.nvim) - Navigate your code with search labels, enhanced character motions, and treesitter inegration
